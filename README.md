# Flight-Managment-System
Flight Management System in C++ 
This Project deals with a real-life problem; managing an airline flight system. I will implement this project using C++, the interface will be command line based. This flight management system will have three major parts namely, booking flights, canceling flights and rescheduling flights. Iâ€™ll also include complementary features, cost of flight and time of flights and even passengers list.
